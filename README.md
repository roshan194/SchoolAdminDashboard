## Testing PWA Features

### Install as App
1. Open the app in Chrome/Edge
2. Look for the install icon in the address bar
3. Click to install as a desktop/mobile app

### Test Push Notifications
1. Click the "Send Notification (Demo)" button on the dashboard
2. Allow notifications when prompted
3. You should see a desktop notification

### Test Offline Mode
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Check "Offline" checkbox
4. Refresh the page - it should still work!

## Customization

### Changing Colors
Edit `client/src/index.css` to customize the color scheme:
```css
:root {
  --primary: hsl(207, 90%, 54%); /* Main brand color */
  --background: hsl(0, 0%, 100%); /* Background color */
  /* ... other color variables */
}
```

### Adding New Pages
1. Create a new component in `client/src/pages/`
2. Add the route in `client/src/App.tsx`
3. Update the sidebar navigation in `client/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`

### Modifying Dashboard Data
Edit the sample data in:
- `client/src/components/DashboardCards.tsx` - Statistics cards
- `client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Events and metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If port 5000 is busy, the app will automatically use the next available port. Check the terminal for the actual URL.

### Dependencies Not Installing
Try clearing npm cache and reinstalling:
```bash
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### PWA Not Working
Make sure you're accessing the app via `http://localhost:5000` (not `127.0.0.1`) and that you've allowed notifications in your browser.
